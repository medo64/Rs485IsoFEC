[Isolated RS-485 Framework Expansion Card](https://medo64.com/rs485isofec/)
===========================================================================

This Framework laptop expansion card will show up on your system as a serial
device and allow for isolated RS-485 communication up to 460,800 baud rate.

Please note that this card is using automatic transmit control and 120Ω
termination.


## Pinout

To connect to this board, one has to use a 4-pin JST XH connector. The following
table represents the pinout, pin 1 being on the left as looking into the
expansion card.

| # | Ref | Description                                     |
|--:|-----|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | GND | Ground connection                               |
| 2 | A   | Negative (low for logic 1 and high for logic 0) |
| 3 | B   | Positive (high for logic 1 and low for logic 0) |
| 4 | NC  | Not connected                                   |

As power consumption is low, wires can be almost any AWG. I would recommend
using 24 AWG wire 0.25 mm² as they allow for greater compatibility with other
connectors.


## Supported Speeds

This board employs the FT232R as its UART chip, and consequently, it supports
all the baud rates this chip [can handle](https://ftdichip.com/Documents/AppNotes/AN232B-05_BaudRates.pdf)
up to 500,000 baud which is the limit of isolator chip used. The table below
lists the standard baud rates.

| Baud rate |    Actual | Error |    Divisor |

|   460,800 |   461,538 | 0.16% |      6.500 |

While rates above this can be set, they are not guaranteed to work.
